# NERD CROPPER #

This project uses mathematical functions like `x^2 + 2x + 5`, `sin(x)`, `cos(x)` to generate images using a Simplex Noise function.

# How to run # 

There's a config file in which you should provide number of `lanes` or `columns`. Number of `lanes` should match the number of `functions` used to generate the image.
Look through the config file, tweak it, and see what happens.

If you have any questions, open an issue.
